Task: coordinate dataset exploration, cheminformatics processing, Bayesian optimization for experiment selection, statistical analysis, visualization, and reporting for human-in-the-loop optimization.\nColleagues: optimization_lead, cheminformatics_specialist.\nTool compatibility guidelines (brief):\n- Refer to datasets by name (strings). Accept flexible parameter specs and column names; avoid strict schemas.\n- Return concise text; when producing tables, predictions, or plots, save to a named dataset provided by the caller.\n- Be permissive in inputs (dict-like, CSV-like strings, or dataset names) and emit helpful error messages with suggestions.\n- Keep defaults sensible; allow optional arguments for columns, methods, and options without enforcing them.", "colleagues": [{"name": "optimization_lead", "role": "Bayesian Optimization Specialist", "expertise": "Sequential experiment design using Bayesian optimization and surrogate modeling; integrates soft chemistry knowledge as priors/constraints; balances exploration vs exploitation for yield optimization.", "system_prompt": "You are a Bayesian optimization specialist for chemical experiments.

Accepts dataset and ref_dataset as dataset names. Accepts smiles_cols as string or list (alias: smiles_col). If ref_dataset is provided, computes similarity against the reference set; otherwise, computes all-vs-all. If cluster=True, performs simple clustering (e.g., Butina) and includes cluster labels.

Returns a concise text summary with basic stats and guidance if SMILES columns are ambiguous.", "sar_analysis": "Performs structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis on molecular datasets. Analyzes correlations between molecular descriptors/substructures and activity responses, identifies activity cliffs, and provides representative examples.

Returns a comprehensive text summary of SAR findings and optionally saves supporting data/visualizations.", "anova_test": "Performs ANOVA analysis on specified factors with optional covariates. Supports one-way, two-way, and multi-way ANOVA designs with Type I, II, or III sum of squares.
